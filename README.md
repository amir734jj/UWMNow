UWMNow
------
UWMNow is a system for UWM students to have a class discussion and see what is happening at UWM at a glance.

To make the development convenient, we use SQLite but you can use almost any other relational database as UWMNow uses ORM and you can easily change the dialect. 

To run the system, make sure you installed [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [SQLite](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm)

And then follow these commands in terminal:

    npm install
    npm server.js
